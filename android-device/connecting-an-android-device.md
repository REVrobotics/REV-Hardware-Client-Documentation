# Connecting an Android Device

### **Android Developer Options**

In order to use the REV Hardware Client the phone's developer settings and USB debugging options need to be turned on. 

The developer options on Android Devices are hidden within the phone as a default. Different phone manufactures have different ways of accessing the developer options. However, once the developer options are available in the phone's settings, the steps for activating USB debugging and development settings are similar. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before moving forward it is advised to look up where the developer options on your Android Device are located. For Motorola users, the [Motorola Support Page](https://support.motorola.com/us/en/solution/ms95240) has information on how to unlock the developer options.

USB debugging is now on! You can move on to the steps for installing the application.

Depending on the device you may need to change the USB Settings from "Charging only" to "File Transfer".

Plug the Android Device with USB Debugging into the Windows PC running the REV Hardware Client.
