# Navigating the Client - SPARK MAX

When a SPARK MAX is connected to the Hardware Client there are multiple [Device Menu Tabs](../getting-started/navigating-the-client.md#device-menu). When a SPARK MAX is selected the Hardware Client will open on the Basic Tab. Follow through this section to learn more about the various Device Menu Tabs.

The API and Update tabs are discussed in the [Updating SPARK MAX Software](updating-spark-max.md) article.

## Run Tab

The Run Tab allows for the SPARK MAX to operate over USB or a USB to CAN Bridge without the need for a full control system. This is helpful for testing mechanisms and tuning their control loops.
